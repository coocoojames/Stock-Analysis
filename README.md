# Stock-Analysis

Analyze Stock Performance

# Purpose of Analysis
When analyzing stock performance, it's important to know the volume traded in a given period of time to weed out penny stocks and determine how active the trading is. In this analysis we compare the total volume traded in a given year and the total return on investment of these 11 stocks.

# Results

## Stock Comparison
First, I created two bar/line combo graphs (link1 & 2)* and find that there isn't a strong correlation between volume traded and the return on investment. Then by creating two line graphs (link3 & 4)*, it's evident that the overall performance of all stocks is much better in the year 2017 with the exception of ENPH and RUN. We can also tell that a lot of these stocks are very volatile and are worth looking into more history of performance.

## Run Times
It depends on the computer but there's a drastic difference in run time between the original and refactored codes. The refactored codes ran in 0.34 seconds (link1)* for 2017 and 0.32 (link2)* for 2018. The original ran in 2.19 seconds (link3)* for 2017 and 2.28 (link4)* for 2018. That's almost 2 seconds apart!

# Summary
## Advantages and Disadvantages
1. A big advantage of refactoring code is the possiblity of a much less run time and less memory taken. Another big advantage is a cleaner code. With a cleaner code comes easier understanding of the code and potentially easier to debug and build on.
2. A big disadvantage of refactoring code is the time commitment it takes to plan and execute a better and cleaner code. Depending on how complicated the code it's also possible to end up making more mistakes or even having a longer run time.

## Original vs. Refactored VBA Script
In this case the run time turned out to be much lower for the refactored script. The thing is the code actually doesn't seem much "cleaner." That being said, because I was able to create one loop to retrieve and store all the data required for the original, the debugging was a lot easier. A big disadvantage was of course the time spent to plan out the variables needed to accomplish this task. Overall, for the project, it was a rather good idea to refactor this code.
